# Git Overview
Unlike OneDrive, Git is not based on a single online file storage, which is replicated on a user's device.  Git is instead a file tracking system on the user's device ("local"), following a set folder ("repository" or "repo") from which the user chooses to manually upload ("push") new and changed files to an online version ("remote") of the repo.  Other users can manually copy ("clone") the remote repo and download ("pull") changes, in order to sync their local repo with the 
remote.
